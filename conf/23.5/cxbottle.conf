;;-----------------< Basic Settings >-----------------------------------
;;
;; MenuRoot Specifies where Wine should create the menu
;; entries for Windows applications, i.e. where
;; the root of the "Start Menu" should be.
;;
;; Default: ""
;;
;; MenuStrip Specifies that the first N Windows menu levels
;; should be stripped. So if MenuStrip is set to
;; one, then a menu that would be in the 'Programs'
;; menu folder on Windows, would appear in the menu
;; root in your desktop environment.

;; Default: 0

;;-----------------< Advanced Settings > -------------------------------
;;
;; BottleID This is a unique id for this bottle. It can be
;; used to tag items as belonging to this bottle
;; and to avoid name conflicts.
;;
;; Default: ""
;;
;; Version This is the CrossOver version that this bottle
;; was created or last upgraded to.
;;
;; Default: ""
;;
;; Timestamp This is the CrossOver build timestamp that this
;; bottle was created or last upgraded to.
;;
;; Default: ""
;;
;; Encoding This is the system character encoding that was
;; used when creating this bottle. In particular
;; this impacts the filenames created by
;; applications which may limit the portability of
;; this bottle to systems using a different
;; encoding.
;;
;; Default: ""
;;
;; Description A string describing the contents of the bottle.
;;
;; Default: ""
;;
;; Template The template this bottle is based on.
;; This setting can use environment variables with
;; the syntax '$ {
	VARNAM
}
'.
;;
;; Default: ""
;;
;; Updater Specifies the path to an executable to be run
;; to update or create the bottle from a central
;; shared location.
;; This option is typically used in multi-user
;; setups to create the bottle directory for
;; new users. If empty, then nothing is done.
;; This setting can use environment variables with
;; the syntax '$ {
	VARNAM
}
'.
;;
;; Default: ""
;;
;; ManagedLinkType A comma-separated list specifying the type of
;; link to be created for the 'Link' policy.
;; 'Symbolic' will cause the creation of a
;; symbolic link while 'Hard' will cause the
;; creation of a hard link. If both are
;; specified then they are tried in turn until
;; one succeeds. Thus order is important.
;;
;; Default: "Symbolic"
;;
;; MenuMode If set to 'install' then the menus will
;; be automatically reinstalled when needed.
;;
;; Default: "ignore"
;;
;; AssocMode If set to 'install' then the associations will
;; be automatically reinstalled when needed.
;;
;; Default: "ignore"
;;
;; AllowUntrusted Don't warn about untrusted applications and
;; documents.
;;
;; Default: 0

;;-----< [ManagedUpdatePolicy] Section >--------------------------------
;; This section defines the update policy for managed mode,
;; that is how files and directories are made available to the
;; per-user bottle stubs. The settings let you specify whether they
;; should be linked (and thus read-only), or copied (and thus
;; writable), ignored, etc.
;;----------------------------------------------------------------------
[ManagedUpdatePolicy]

;;-----------------< Update Policy Definition >-------------------------
;;
;; This is a set of key/value pairs.
;;
;; Each key is a regular expression which matches one or more files in
;; the current bottle. All regular expressions are case insensitive.
;; Using '^' and '$' to anchor the regular expression at the start and
;; end of the file or directory name is recommended.
;;
;; Some regular expression examples:
;; * ^drive_c/Windows/System
;; Matches all files and directories in 'c:\Windows\System' but also
;; 'c:\Windows\System32' or any other file or directory located in
;; 'c:\Windows' with a name starting with 'System'.
;;
;; * ^drive_c/Windows/System/
;; Matches all files and directories in 'c:\Windows\System'.
;;
;; * ^drive_c/Windows/System$
;; Matches the 'c:\Windows\System' directory but not files or
;; directories contained therein.
;;
;; * ^drive_c/Windows/(system|win)\.ini$
;; Matches 'c:\Windows\System.ini' and 'c:\Windows\win.ini'.
;;
;; * \.scr$
;; Matches all files and directories with a '.scr' extension.
;;
;;
;; The value associated with each regular expression specifies how to
;; make corresponding the files and directories accessible to the user,
;; and how to deal with modifications.
;;
;; Delete Delete the file or directory from the user's
;; stub bottle. Note that this policy has the
;; potential of deleting whole directory
;; hierarchies and should thus be used with
;; caution.
;; ** Use with caution **
;;
;; Ignore Ignore the file or directory.
;; Matched files and directories will not be copied
;; to the user's bottle stub, and will be ignored
;; if they are found in there.
;; Note that since directories are skipped
;; entirely, this policy causes their contents to
;; be ignored too.
;;
;; Link Link the user's file to the managed bottle's
;; file. Directories are copied.
;; This policy is space efficient but makes the
;; file read-only. Because of this it should not
;; be used for files containing user settings.
;; Note that directories are still copied, it is
;; only the files they contain that are created as
;; links. This is so that the user can add new
;; files to these directories.
;; ** This is the default policy **
;;
;; LinkDir Link the user's file or directory to the managed
;; bottle's file or directory.
;; This is very space efficient, especially for
;; directories where it also saves on inode usage.
;; However it makes the whole directory read-only,
;; thus preventing the user from adding / removing
;; any file to / from it.
;; ** Use with caution **
;;
;; Copy Copies the file to the user's stub bottle
;; This increases disk usage but makes the files
;; modifiable by the user and is thus required
;; when they contain user settings.
;; If the managed bottle's file is then modified,
;; the user's file will not be updated unless the
;; 'ReplaceFiles' option is used (see below).
;;
;; Registry Marks the file as a registry file.
;; Registry files are copied to the user's stub
;; bottle but allow changes in the managed bottle's
;; registry to be merged at the individual key /
;; value level.
;; Unless the 'ReplaceFiles' option is used, only
;; new keys and values are merged to the user's
;; registry. This preserves the user's settings
;; for that registry file.
;; If you wish to overwrite the registry file
;; wholesale, use the 'Copy' policy.
;; ** To be used only on registry files **
;;
;; For the 'Link', 'LinkDir', 'Copy' and 'Registry' policies,
;; one can specify extra options specifying what to do if the user
;; file no longer matches the managed bottle's file. To do so specify
;; one of the following after a comma:
;;
;; ReplaceFiles This option applies to files only.
;; It specifies that the content of the managed
;; bottle's file should replace the content of the
;; user's file whenever managed bottle's file is
;; modified.
;; For the 'Registry' policy, this applies at the
;; individual registry key / value level so that
;; the managed bottle's keys / values are added or
;; replace the user's key / values. However any
;; extra key / value created by the user is
;; preserved.
;; Finally this specifies that if a file violates
;; policy (for instance it was copied but the
;; current policy specifies it should be a link),
;; then remedial action will be taken.
;;
;; ReplaceDirs Directories violating policy will be replaced.
;; For instance if the policy dictates linking to
;; the managed bottle's directory but a copy is
;; found instead, then the directory will be
;; deleted and replaced with a link.
;; Note that this option has the potential of
;; deleting whole directory trees and should thus
;; be used with caution.
;;
;; ReplaceConflicting If set, then files that should be directories or
;; vice versa will be replaced.
;;
;; Finally, note that if more than one regular expression matches a
;; given file name, then the first one is used.
;; Thus the order of the rules below is important.
